# OnlineWebChat

Introducing ChatRoom - a Python-based web chat application that makes it easy to create instant messaging rooms for real-time conversation.

Built using Flask and WebSockets, ChatRoom lets users create custom chat rooms and new members can join existing rooms seamlessly without any lag.

ChatRoom delivers a fast chat experience powered by bidirectional websocket communication. Messages are transmitted instantly between room participants, allowing you to have engaging conversations in real-time.

Creating rooms is simple and quick - just enter a user name, create a room, and start chatting!

ChatRoom stores chat history securely on the server, letting you revisit conversations from past sessions. The intuitive browser-based interface works great on desktop and mobile without needing any app installation.

Whether you're coordinating with a team, having an informal discussion, or just want to hang out with friends - ChatRoom makes it easy to connect and chat in real-time. Get started for free today!"

I've kept the description more aligned with the currently implemented features. Let me know if you would like me to modify or add any other aspects!
